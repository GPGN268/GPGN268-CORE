# Final Project Worksheet

## Create a MarkDown file in your cousework repository. 
- You can do this with the text editor from Jupyter Lab if you prefer

```bash
$ cd ~/work/classes/GPGN268/coursework-villasboas
$ jupyter lab
```
- Then go to File-> New-> Markdown File. Right click on your file (on the left toolbar) and rename it to `project-worksheet-draft.md`
- If you right-click on the jupyter lab text editor, there will be an option "Show Markdown Preview", which will open the renderized Markdown file on a separate panel.

- Copy the Template below to your file and complete the prompts.
- If you already have a group, great! You can discuss this as a group, but complete the worksheet individually. If you have chosen a topic, but don't have a group yet, also great! Go trhough the exercise below regardless. 
- After completing the prompts in the worksheet, save the file, shutdown Jupyter Lab, add your file to git, commit, and push. 
- Prepare a ~1 min pitch based on the worksheet to share with the class on **Thursday, Feb 13**.
